# Pyrolysis-Simulator
The main objective of the present work was to evaluate the feasibility of treating urban plastic waste through the simulation of an optimized pyrolysis process, aiming at its utilization as a raw material in fuel production. The pyrolysis process was modeled using the PYTHON programming language.
